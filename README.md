# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where the request body is not parsed correctly when the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect. The bug occurs because the `express.json()` middleware expects the `Content-Type` header to be set to `application/json`.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js application that attempts to parse a JSON request body. However, if the request is sent without a `Content-Type` header or with an incorrect header, the `req.body` will be empty, leading to unexpected behavior.  

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by adding a check for the `Content-Type` header and parsing the request body manually if necessary. This approach ensures that the application correctly handles requests regardless of the presence or value of the header.  This approach provides a more robust solution, especially in cases where client-side code might not set the header correctly.
